which caused the death of thousands of Christians and expelled them from the Mountain
area.
At the end of the civil war in 1990, as Christian-Muslim relations improved, many
Christians started to return to their villages. The government even started to financially
aid them to renovate or build new houses.
The struggle with the Muslims caused the Christians to slowly surrender their traditional
hold of power and opted to emigrate seeking a better future.
The decline of the Christian power in Lebanon can be also traced to internal divisions and
infighting among the Christians themselves. The Phalanges saw that the Maronite
political pluralism ought perhaps to be tolerated, but the community's military power had
to be under one authority, and that authority had to be theirs[5]. For this reason the
Phalanges sought to break the independent power of their two principal partners, the
Franjiyya and the Liberal National Party. The relations with Franjiyya worsened after they
disagreed over relations with Syria.
The Phalanges sought to expand their party organisation into Northern Lebanon and to
undermine the Franjiyya family's economic base by disputing Franjiyya's right to raise
levies in the heavily industrialised region around Chekka, South of Tripoli[6]. Franjiyya
responded to the challenge by killing the chief Phalanges organiser, Jud Bayeh. The
Phalanges retaliated by shelling Tony Franjiyya's home in the village of Ehden, killing him
and his immediate family in June 1978[7]. Itamar Rabinovich questioned whether or not
his assassination had been planned; it is obvious that excessive brutality divided the
Christian camp[8]. Franjiyya accused Lebanese Forces of collaboration with Israel and
opted to side with Syria[9].
In 1980, Bashir Gemayel's militia destroyed the military infrastructure of the Tigers, the
National Liberal Party's militia, in the Beirut area. The Phalanges sought to expand their
mandate and their demographic and territorial bases by becoming the representative
authority for all Lebanese Christians not just the Maronites[10].
On 31 January 1990, after the Lebanese forces announced its reluctant endorsement of
the Ta'if Accord, Michel Aoun had to consolidate his position with his Christian
constituency. He attempted to wrest control of the small Christian area between Beirut
and Jebail, but in the process inaugurated a Christian civil war in January 1990[11]. Kail
Ellis commented that the conflict lasted until July of that year and ended without a clear-
cut victory for Aoun[12]. Before the fighting stopped in mid-March, nearly 750 civilians
had been killed and 3,000 wounded, but the Lebanese Forces continued to support the
new accord[13]. Ellis noted that the war had negative political consequences for the
Christian community and that it was estimated that the war had caused $1.2 billion in
property damage[14].
Another reason for the decline of Christian influence in Lebanon is that not all Christians
shared the dream of a Christian state. For example, Christian members of both Lebanese
communists and the national progressive parties aimed for a non-secular political system
and called for the abolition of the religious based political system. Theodore Hanf noted
that the civil war between the Christian communities had weakened them more than all
the previous attacks of Lebanese and foreign foes[15].
Christian relations with foreign powers have also contributed to their decline. In the
words of Lebanon's premier columnist, Ghassan Tueni, it was the others' war. Lebanon
was used as a battlefield for the ongoing clashes in the Middle East and the superpower
rivalries resulting from the cold war[16].
Eyal Zisser commented that stronger relations between Israel and the Lebanese Maronite
community inevitably led to the civil war in Lebanon in 1975[17]. Eyal added that such
relations were founded on the common belief that Jews and Maronites must forge a
strong alliance to ward off hostile Muslim-Arab attacks[18].
Brenda Seaver outlined that without Palestinians; the Lebanese system might have
persisted:
At the very least, if the Palestinian problem had never existed, there would have been more
time for strong elites to emerge who could have dealt with the difficulties of modernisation
by carrying on the Shihab tradition of social reforms and instituting moderate political
reforms[19]
Brenda Seaver gave an accurate analysis of the Palestinians contribution to the collapse
of the Lebanese political system. The Palestinians might have tried to turn Lebanon into
an alternative permanent state, as compensation for their homeland. The Palestinians'
interference worsened the already tense relations between Christians and Muslims.
Despite the several episodic civil wars between Muslims and Christians, the whole
population had co-operated together for many centuries.
Syria has also played a big role in the decline of the Christian's role in Lebanon, despite
its initial intervention militarily in their favour in 1976. When in 1976, the Lebanese
National Movement LMN that was fighting Christian forces was about to gain victory over
the Christian; the Syrians intervened, explicitly stating that their reason for doing so was
to help the Christians[20].
Ghassan Hage explored the reasons behind Syria's help for the Christians in 1976:
Undoubtedly, however, it aimed to avoid the creation of a mini Christian state that the
Christians would have proclaimed in all likelihood in the areas that remained under their
control[21].
It is important to note that Syria helped the Christians to secure a foothold in Lebanon.
However, the Christian leaders, who governed Lebanon at the start of the civil war, failed
to predict the implication of Syria's initial friendly intervention in Lebanon. Rex Brynen
noted that the massive Syrian military intervention in Lebanon served to Arabise the
Lebanese civil war, substantially shifting the conflict from its initial Lebanese social and
political bases to the broader regional arena[22].
The honeymoon between the Christians and the Syrians was short lived. Ghassan Hage
said that following Egyptian president Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem, an Israeli
conceived peace plan (what became known as the Begin plan') emerged allowing for a
role of the Christian Right, namely the Phalanges. They did not hesitate to grab the
opportunity and quickly turned against Syria[23].
On February 7, 1978 a limited armed confrontation between the Syrians and some
Christian elements of the Lebanese army took place. Soon after, this confrontation
developed into a full-scale war[24]. The Begin plan allowed Israel to invade and stay in
South Lebanon until a permanent solution prevented the Palestinian guerrilla from
returning[25]. Here, the Christians represented by the Lebanese Front, took its most
extremist stand on the Palestinian presence in Lebanon and called for the elimination of
the Palestinians armed presence[26]. Syria was furious at the Christians' apparent siding
with Israel and so began bombardment of the Christian quarters of Beirut[27].
Ghassan Hage presented the reasons for the Syrian aggression against the Christians:
It was a reflection of the frustration of Syrian President Assad to see the Christian rightists,
whom he had basically saved, and whom he had attempted to handle with the utmost care,
move away from him with ease[28].
There was some notion in 1978 that Syria and the Muslims wanted to eradicate the
uniqueness of Lebanon and the Christian presence in it. This led Camille Chamoun to call
on the ”civilised world” to stop the Syrian bombardment of the Christian area[29].
Christian civilians paid a high price for the political mistakes of their own leaders. Those
leaders did not foresee that Syria would demand full support for its policies, which shifted
again to support the Palestinian presence in the South, something that is against the
Christian's principle of a free Lebanon. The civilians were bombed every time their
leaders disagreed with Syria or the Muslim militias, namely the Lebanese national
movement.
The conflict was between Christians and Muslims, more precisely between Christians in
Libanon against Muslim Syria and and thousands of Iranian revolutionary
guards[Hezbollah]:
- the struggle for Lebanon was conducted between Maronite leaders in East Beirut and
Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus[30].
Following the end of the civil war in 1990, the political power of the Christians declined
even further. Alan George described how the Maronites were marginalised:
- Their selective representation in the political hierarchy and the exile or imprisonment of
leading political figures[31].
The Christians' position declined even further, when a major ally of the past, the United
States, refrained from urging Syria to withdraw. In 1958, the United States rushed to
help president Camille Chamoun to quell a rebellion, which was staged, by Muslims and
followers of former Egyptian president Abdel Nasser. Later, however, The United States
abandoned its role in Lebanon, owing to the fact that in 1983 the American embassy in
Ain al-Mreisse was demolished by a suicide bomb attack that killed more than 60
people[32]. Six months later, suicide bombers made simultaneous attacks on the
multinational force that arrived a year earlier at the request of President Amin Gemayel.
The results of the attacks were devastating when 58 French paratroopers and 241
Americans marines were killed. Finally the Americans pulled out of Lebanon.
The Christians in Lebanon felt uneasy about the United States failure to demand Syria's
withdrawal from Lebanon. Jose Navalpotro wrote that the United States believed that the
timetable for the Syrian withdrawal was a matter that should be resolved between
Damascus and Beirut[33]. He added that Washington does not regard this question as an
important issue in the overall stability of the Middle East, or a pivotal matter to be
resolved in the Arab-Israeli peace process[34].
Christian Emigration from Lebanon, in large numbers, also contributed to the decline of
the Christian influence in Lebanon. Both Muslims and Christians fled Lebanon, but far
more Christians left. From a pre-war Lebanese population of roughly 4 million, 500,000
of the 700,000 who emigrated were Christian. Just how many Christians remain in
Lebanon is in dispute. There are no official population figures for Lebanon. Some
estimate that about 1 million residents or 25 percent of the country are Christians. This
figure is less than half of the nearly 60 per cent majority of the early 1970s.
William Harris saw that Christian numbers declined in Lebanon as the years
went by[35].
1911 79% Christian
1921 55%
1932 51%
1943 52%
1970 42%
1990 35%
(2008 25%)
It is hard to see the Christians current decline in status to be reversed in the view of
Harris's statistics. It is very plausible that the number of Christians will become negligible
in 50 years and thus their presence in the Middle East will be in jeopardy. Christians need
to have the numbers in order to have a legitimate claim to sharing power with the
Muslims. Charles M.Sennott quoted a Christian lawyer Nehmatalla Abi Nasr talking about
the effect of Christian migration:
"The Christians leave for opportunity in the West or to get away from the war,'he
says,'Then they lose more and more influence here, and then they are increasingly afraid to
return. This process feeds on itself."[36].
The migration of many Christians from Lebanon has indeed contributed to their political
decline in a nation, where they used to be the majority. The voluntary migration adds to
the fact that thousands and thousands of Christians died in a war or faced expulsion from
their own houses and lands. The Maronite patriarch, Cardinal Nsrallah Boutrous Sfeir,
complains stridently that an upsurge in non-Christian immigration to Lebanon, coupled
with the government's recent decision to grant citizenship to a large number of Muslims,
is weakening the Christian voice in Lebanon,[37]
Chapter 7 - The End of the Lebanese Civil War and the Ta'if Agreement the ”last
straw”.
The Lebanese Civil war ended in 1990 following the defeat of the Lebanese Army leader
Aoun by Syria's intervened military. William Harris saw the collapse of the autonomous
Christian enclave of East Beirut as a blow to Christian power in Lebanon[1].
The Christians had not just faced a traumatic end to their autonomy on 13 April, but they
had to face the consequences of the implementation of the Ta'if agreement, which
reduced their power in favour of the Muslims.
On the 30th of September 1989, the Arab League plan, hereafter referred to as the Ta'if
Accord, was signed in the resort city of Ta'if. The 62 Lebanese members of Parliament, 85
percent of the surviving 73 members who met in Saudi Arabia, included 31 Christian and
31 Muslim deputies[2]. Many Christians considered that this agreement as the single
event that sealed their downfall. The agreement united the nation but failed to give the
Christians the necessary guarantee for their survival.
Following the Ta'if agreement, more ambitious Islamic leaders found an opportunity to
consolidate their political gains, and gradually eliminated the Christian presence from the
national government[3]. Catholic leaders were against the new agreement. Jose
Navalpotro wrote:
Cardinal Sfeir put the question in sharp relief. Without a strong Christian presence in
government, he asked, what would be the incentive to maintain an independent Lebanon?
And without a clear agreement with their Muslim neighbours, how could a Christian
minority in one small country expect to survive in an"Islamic ocean?".
The Ta'if agreement emphasised three factors: Firstly, that the new preamble to the
constitution unequivocally stressed Lebanon's Arab identity and affiliation. Secondly, that
the new preamble should state that Lebanon's system should be based on social justice
and equality between all citizens in rights and duties without any differentiation and
preference. Thirdly it called for the abolition of political sectarianism.
Sami Ofeish asserted that Ta'if addressed the causes of the Lebanese Civil War[5]. Article
24 of the Ta'if accord presents the guidelines for the sectarian distribution of seats in
parliament. This article affirms that, until parliament enacts non-sectarian electoral laws,
parliamentary seats should be distributed equally between Christians and Muslims[6].
Sami Ofeish commented that the principles of sectarian "proportional representation"
were not implemented accurately in the past and they did not accommodate the
demographic changes showing Muslims as the numerical majority beginning in the
1960s[7].
The Ta'if ‘s agreement improved the position of the prime minister at the expense of the
President's traditional functions. According to article 64, the Prime Minister is now the
one who heads the government and acts as its representative. The Parliamentary
Speaker (A Shiite)'s term is extended to four years instead of one as in the past
according to article 44.
The Maronite-exclusive Presidency was rendered to be more symbolic. Sami Ofeish wrote
that despite the fact that the President is still the head of the state (Article 49), his
executive power lies mainly with the council of ministers (Article 17), and the president
shares the decision-making with the Prime Minister and the council[8].
As we can clearly see, three Presidents rule Lebanon equally, the President of the
Republic, the President of Council of Ministers and the President of the Chamber of
Deputies. It is important to see that Ta'if reduced the Christian political power in Lebanon
in favour of the Muslims.
Christine Asmar saw that the Ta'if agreement did not provide any solutions to the
Lebanese political power:
Ta'if was also to have signalled a thaw in inter-confessional hostilities, but instead it may
have simply frozen animosities while facilitating the restoration of a central government,
leaving unresolved the vital issue of inter-confessional relations, especially at the level of
the "street[9].
One of the consequences of the Ta'if agreement was the signing of a treaty of
brotherhood, cooperation and coordination between Syria and Lebanon[10]. A majority of
Christians voiced their concern about the treaty. William Harris commented on the
Christian opposition to Ta'if:
Most Christians rejected the Ta'if regime, as they felt alienated both from Christian
participants in the government and from other Christian parties, principally the Kata'ib and
the LF, which had accepted the new order but dissented on details[11].
Christians boycotted the first post Ta'if’s agreement election in 1992. Judith Harik noted
that the Lebanese Maronite community feared that a new parliament would enact laws to
end its privileged position in Lebanese society and politics[12]. The Maronites wanted the
Syrians out of Lebanon, and believed that elections held before the Syrians departure might
be unduly influenced by Syria at their expense[13]. Judith Harik stated that the Christians
boycotted the 1992 election, because they felt that the new parliament would not represent
their interests[14].
The Christians' fears were to become a reality when a pro Syrian President was elected in
1993. The new parliaments after 1990 did not contain strong nationalist Christians as
before. In the last election of 2000, only a few Christian nationalists were elected, in
contrast to 1972 where most Christian members of parliament were Christian
nationalists.
The decline of the Christian political influence coincided with the economic rise of the
Muslims. Jose Navalpotro wrote:
Under Hariri's regime, the financial aid which is flowing into the country from other Arabic
nations is being directed toward institutions controlled by Muslims[15].
The Christians long time financial superiority over Muslims has finally come to an end.
Other Arabic countries are financially aiding Muslim institutions. Muslim wealth has
doubled since the end of the civil war in 1990. It is no secret that the current Prime
Minister Rafic Hariri's private company Solidaire owns the central business district of
Beirut. Moreover, it tenders all government major construction work. Muslim new wealth
is channelling new financial and political power for the Muslims. Moreover, the poor Shi'ite
area of the South is attracting more government and overseas developments.
Among the Christian leaders who remain active in Lebanon, there is a fervent desire for
new negotiations. That desire is based on the recognition that they are rapidly losing
their political influence. The principal institutions that could offer them access to power
are now closed to Christians, or at least offer only the hope of a minor role.
Jose Navalpotro noted that there is an absence of strong Christian leadership. He
observed that the former Lebanese army commander Michel Aoun is in exile in France,
the former president Amin Gemayel was residing in the United States for several years
after the end of his presidency in 1988, and Dory Chamoun, who succeeded his
assassinated brother Danny, has been unable to mount the sort of sustained and
strategic action that would give a sense of new hope to his followers[16]. The Gemayel
family finally returned in 2000 and Amin Gemayel's son Pierre was elected to the
parliament in late 2000.
The absence of strong Christian leaders impedes the Christian community of exercising a
powerful influence as in the past. The decline of Christian influence will even increase if
there continues to be an absence of a strong Christian leader who mobilises his
community and enables it to survive. Another important Christian leader, Samir Geagea,
the leader of the Lebanese forces militia, is currently in prison. Navalpotro wrote that in
March 1994 the government outlawed his Lebanese forces party, and arrested him. He
was accused of engineering the bombing of a Catholic church in Beirut and the
assassination of Danny Chamoun.
The Catholic bishops pointed out in their public denunciation of Geagea's imprisonment
that the government had produced no evidence to sustain the charges[17]. Since the
formal conclusion of the Lebanese civil war on October 13, 1990, many episodes have
borne testimony to the steadily diminishing influence of the Christians in Lebanon.
1990 October - Danny Chamoun, the key leader among Maronite Christians, is
assassinated, along with his family.
1991 May - Patriarch Sfeir denounces the Syria-Lebanon pact, saying that it
compromises the nation's sovereignty and undermines the "national pact" of 1943.
August-General Michel Aoun, the latest Christian leader to emerge as a national power
broker, is sent into exile in France, and prohibited from returning to Lebanon for five
years.
1992 September - Catholics organise a boycott of legislative elections; between 70 and
85 percent of all Catholics refuse to participate. One Christian deputy was elected by just
winning forty votes[18].
1993 May - Anti-Catholic rioting breaks out in the region of Chouf. The bishops of
Lebanon speak out against the purchase of lands in Christian neighbourhoods, which they
point out is changing the demographic face of the nation.
June - Three terrorists die in the premature explosion of a bomb they were preparing at
the site of a meeting of Orthodox and Catholic bishops
October - Christian political leaders are the targets in a series of arrests; several are
taken to Damascus and held there.
December - A Christian cemetery is desecrated in Mansourieh, an apparent warning to
Christians that they should not celebrate Christmas.
1994 February - A bomb placed in a Catholic Church explodes during Mass, killing eight
worshippers; the terrorist act following several days after the massacre of Muslims by an
Israeli extremist in Hebron.
June - Prime minister Hariri ordered the shut down of ICN television and the Nida'al
Watan daily newspaper after they expressed concerns by Christians over the prime
minister's land purchases in traditionally Christian areas[19].
July - The Maronite bishops issued a new warning about the loss of equilibrium between
Christians and Muslims in the nation's government.
2000 January - A group of Islamic militants stormed a Christian village killing one
resident, while engaging in fighting with the Lebanese Army.
September - The Maronite Bishops' council called for the withdrawal of Syria from
Lebanon, thus voicing a Christian protest to such presence.
December - Syria freed about 50 mostly Lebanese Christians political prisoners.
However, human rights groups have put the number of Lebanese political prisoners in
Syrian jails at anywhere between several hundred and several thousand[20].
2001 August - The arrest of 200 Christian youths following their demands at a rally for
a Syrian withdrawal. The former advisor to Samir Geagea, Twefic Hindi, was arrested as
well as Aoun's representative Nadim Lteif. They were accused of collaboration with Israel
and treason.
September - The Maronite Bishops'Council renewed its call for the withdrawal and asked
Christians not to leave the country.
October - Two churches in Sidon and Tripoli were attacked, reinforcing the fact that
Christians are still finding it very hard to be optimistic about their safety in their
homeland.
2002 January - The former commander of the Phalangist army (Lebanese the Serbs. Tito’s motto was “For a strong Yugoslavia we need a weak Serbia”.
Thus, in 1961 the Albanians numbered 650,000 people, and the analogy was 65%
Albanians, 28% Serbians. From that period onwards a dramatic –And basically
unexplained- population expansion derived from the Albanian community. In the mid-60’s
the Albanian population had a 6.5 children per woman ratio, whilst the Serbians around
2.5. Although the second number is enough to replace the previous generation, it was
much less and that resulted in a virtual takeover of the land by the Albanians.
In 1981 just after Tito’s death and the start of the first rebellions in Pristina, the
Albanians numbered 1.2 million, a 100% increase in less than 20 years. The pressure
exercised by them against the Serbian farmers that took the form of homicides, arsons,
rapes and vandalism obliged to an exodus a considerable part of the Christian populous.
[1]
Since 13/06/1999, 350,000 Serbians, Roma, Gorani and other were forced to flee from
Kosovo. It was a flight of survival, considering the 1,500 homicides against Serbs in the
coming months, up to early 2000. Around 80 UNESCO “protected” Christian monuments
were blown up by the Albanians in front of the eyes of 40,000 KFOR personnel. It has to
be stressed once more that even during the days of the Ottoman Empire and the
numerous battles in the eparchy, nowhere close did the destruction of shrines came that
close. Another 1,300 Serbs were killed up to 2003, 80,000 houses and estates were
grabbed by the Albanians along with 20,000 automobiles and 15,000 shops, barns and
commercial property. Some other 30,000 houses were burned to the ground in well-
organised arson a campaigns another method regularly exercised by Kosovo-Albanians
over the 20th century. It is also interesting to point out the situation in Pristina, the
capital of Kosovo. Until 1999, Serbians constituted some 20% of the population.
Nowadays there is a mere 0.1% having being entirely wiped out. In 2004 the last phase
of the most recent genocide in a European soil (By Muslims against Christians) took
place. In a space of 2 days, 27 Churches were burned to the ground, 7 Serbian villages,
40 people dead, 1,000 wounded and 4,000 refugees on their way to Serbia.
Destruction of monasteries and churches in Kosovo[2]
According to the data from the Serbian Orthodox Church, nearly 150 churches and
monasteries have been destroyed for the last five years in Kosovo and Metochia, the
cradle of Serbian Orthodoxy.
Wahabism in Kosovo[3]
In 2002, soon after the invasion of Albanian terrorists in Macedonia, the local
government presented a 79 page report to the CIA, which highlighted the collaboration of
Albanians and Al Qaida on the Balkans. Since 1999, in Kosovo, there have been built 24
Wahhabi mosques, 14 orphanages, and 24 elementary schools all sponsored by the
Wahhabi network. The situation in Albania is similar where the religious leader is a
disciple of the Wahhabi’s of Saudi Arabia.

population) The Serbian population of Kosovo, in contrast, increased in only absolute terms (171,000, 189,000, 227,000, and
228,000 in 1948, 1953, 1961, and 1971, respectively), while initially stagnating and then declining in relative terms (23.6%,
23.5%, 23.6%, and 18.4%). By 1981, however, there were 209,792 Serbs in Kosovo, comprising only 13.2% of the total
population. Therefore, between 1971 and 1981, the number of Serbs in Kosovo decreased by 18,472 in absolute terms.” “The
Montenegrin population of Kosovo increased during the first three censuses after World War II (28,000, 31,000, and 37,000 in
1948, 1951, and 1961, respectively), while in 1971 and 1981 their total population dropped first to 31,500 in 1971 and then to
26,000 in 1981. In 1981 the Montenegrins accounted for only 1.7% of the total Kosovo population. The pressure exerted on
Serbs and Montenegrins by Albanians, including “many cases of physical attack, attempted rape, damage to crops, [and the]
desecration of Serbian monuments and gravestones,” has created a tense atmosphere conducive to Slav emigration from the
area.”

3.1.28 Palestine for the Syrians?
By Daniel Pipes
The terms; Palestine and Palestinians are Islamic imperialist phenomenon. There is no
such thing as a Palestinian people. Before 1948, they were referred to as Syrians. There
was only Syria. The Palestinian phenomenon was created with the intention to justify
Jihad.
During a meeting with leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in 1976,
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad referred to Palestine as a region of Syria, as Southern
Syria. He then went on to tell the Palestinians: "You do not represent Palestine as much
as we do. Do not forget one thing: there is no Palestinian people, no Palestinian entity,
there is only Syria! You are an integral part of the Syrian people and Palestine is an
integral part of Syria. Therefore it is we, the Syrian authorities, who are the real
representatives of the Palestinian people."
Although unusually candid, this outburst exemplifies a long tradition of Syrian politics,
and one that has gained increasing importance in recent years. The Asad government
presents itself as not just an Arab state protecting the rights of the Palestinians but as
the rightful ruler of the land that Israel controls. According to this view, the existing
republic of Syria is but a truncated part of the Syrian lands; accordingly, the government
in Damascus has a duty to unite all Syrian regions, including Palestine, under its control.
The growth in Syrian military capabilities in recent years makes these ambitions a major
source of instability throughout the Levant. Indeed, the Syrian claim to "Southern Syria"
has become central to the Arab-Israeli conflict; Syrian has become not only Israel's
principal opponent, but also the PLO's. Damascus is likely to retain this role for many
years, certainly as long as Hafiz al-Asad lives, and probably longer.
When Asad uses the term Southern Syria, he implicitly harks back to the old meaning of
the name "Syria." Historically, "Syria" (Suriya or Sham in Arabic) refers to a region far
larger than the Syrian Arab Republic of today. At a minimum, historic Syria stretches
from Anatolia to Egypt, and from Iraq to the Mediterranean Sea. In terms of today's
political geography, it comprises all of four states-Syria, Jordan, Israel, and Lebanon-as
well as the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and substantial portions of south-eastern Turkey.
To distinguish this territory from the present Syrian state, it is known as Greater Syria.
Until 1920, Syria meant Greater Syria to everyone, European and Middle Easterner alike;
For example, an early nineteenth-century Egyptian historian, 'Abd ar-Rahman al-Jabarti,
referred to the inhabitants of El Arish in the Sinai Peninsula as Syrians. Palestine was
called Southern Syria first in French, then in other languages, including Arabic. The 1840
Convention of London called the area around Akko "the southern part of Syria" and the
11th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (published in 1911) explains that Palestine
"may be said generally to denote the southern third of the province of Syria." These
examples could be multiplied a thousand-fold.
Creating a separate Palestinian state is as ridiculous as creating a separate state called
Kosovo. There are only two rightful claimants of Kosovo. Albania and Serbia. Just like
Syria and Israel in the Palestinian conflict.

Self interest and treason
It’s apparent that nations who act in accordance with their own short term goals alone
show no consideration for historical perspectives.
Where there should be a joint anti-Jihad action by the affected nations there is no action,
no consultation, no planning, just short term self interest.
Historical examples
- Europe’s refusal to aid Christian protectorates in the Middle East.
- Europe’s refusal to aid the Christian Byzantine Empire against the Jihadi invasions.
- The Venetians refusal to side with the Serbians against the Ottoman invasions
(Svemirko's note).
- Napoleon invades Egypt in 1798 and takes control over Christian Malta and Christian
Palestine. However, Britain fights France defending the Ottomans.
Napoleon withdraws, the Turks regain Egypt, and Britain is rewarded with Malta.
- The Ottomans lose more lands from their crumbling Empire. During the series of wars
between 1806 and 1812, the Russians crush the Ottomans, who sign the Treaty of
Bucharest. One day after the Treaty, Napoleon attacks Russia.
- In 1854 Britain and France along with the Ottomans go to war against Russia in the
Crimean Peninsula. The allied forces defeat Russia and impose heavy conditions in the
Treaty of Paris, signed in 1856.
- Bosnia revolts against the taxation in 1875 and Bulgaria follows in 1876 to become free
from the Ottomans. The Turks ruthlessly massacre more than 12 000 men, women and
children in Bulgaria, and thousands more all over the Balkans. The Treaty of Kucuk
Kaynarca of 1774 gave Russia the right to interfere in Ottoman affairs to protect the
Sultan’s Christian subjects. The British Government defends the Ottoman actions, and a
furious Russia declares war.
The war of 1877-78 takes place in the Balkans and on the Caucasus fronts. The Russians
along with other volunteer ethnic armies deal the Ottomans a crushing defeat.
- In March of 1878 and under pressure from Britain, Russia enters into a settlement
under the Treaty of San Stefano, in which the Ottoman Empire recognises the
independence of Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, and autonomy of Bulgaria.
- For commercial and political interests in mind, Britain’s Disraeli and the Austrians insist
that a new treaty be drawn up in June of that year, at a congress of powers in Berlin.
At the Congress of Berlin, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro were recognised as
independent. And autonomous Bulgaria was greatly reduced and the Austro-Hungarian
Empire occupies Bosnia-Herzegovina. An Armenian delegation headed by Bishop Mkrtich
Khrimian is sent with a formal request for implementation of the reforms for Armenians.
Germany’s Bismarck dismisses the delegation and refuses them a place on the agenda.
Britain secretly agrees with the Ottoman Empire that it would militarily protect it from
Russia and receives Cyprus in exchange.Disraeli reverses article 16 to 61, which returns two Armenian provinces with no Russians
or Europeans to protect the Armenians. It leaves the same abusing Sultan as the
“guarantor” of their security from Muslim continuing abuses.
- After the Russo-Turkish War, the treatment of the more than 2,5 million Armenians by
the Ottoman Government became an international issue. Despite the promises of reform
by the Sublime Porte at the Congress of Berlin, the situation even grew worse.
- 1945-> After the war the Soviet Union attempts to annul the Treaty of Kars with Turkey
and return parts of Northwestern Armenia. These efforts are halted by intervention from
Winston Churchill and Harry S. Truman.
- The close relationship with the United States begins with the Second Cairo Conference
in December 4-6, 1943 and the agreement of July 12, 1947 which implements the
Truman Doctrine. After 1945, in light of the Soviet domination over Eastern Europe, the
US supports Greece and Turkey with economic and military aid to prevent their falling
into the Soviet sphere. The act grant Turkey more than 100 million USD in aid.
- On June 25, 1950 the Korean War starts. Despite being criticised inside Turkey, the
Army along with other 16 nations goes to war against North Korea. Turkey participates in
this campaign in order to gain membership in NATO, which Turkey joins in 1952.
The Bulgarian- Turkish Plot
Bulgaria, half Turkish itself, entered into the plot to exterminate the Greek Christians, by
signing a pact with Turkey, at Adrianople in June, 1915. Under this agreement Bulgaria
consented to the establishment of a Turco-Bulgar commercial union as the complement
of the political union, the seizure of the commerce of the Orient from the hands of the
Greeks, (3) the establishment in the Orient of Moslem agencies for the importation and
exportation of goods for the exclusive use of Moslems, who were to break of all
commercial relations with the Greeks, a restriction of the privileges of the Greek Patriarch
and his ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the prohibition of the teaching of Greek in future, (6)
the conversion by force of the people in the Christian settlements and the
imposition of mixed marriages.
Germany the Author of the Massacres
Herr Lepsius, a German Envoy who had been sent to Constantinople on a special mission
in July, 1915, acknowledged that the Greek and Armenian massacres were two phases of
a single program of extermination of the Christian elements, intended to make Turkey a
purely Moslem state.
That Germany was the author and inspiration of these massacres of Christians became
known in 1917. The Greek Minister at Constantinople, M. Kallerghis, had protested the
Turkish Grand Vizier, Talaat Bey, against the deportations of the Greeks in the Aival
district. Talaat Bey promised to telegraph to the German General Liman von Sanders,
telling him to cease the deportations. Von Sanders, who was in fact Commander-in-Chief
of all the Turkish forces, replied that if the deportations ceased, he would not guarantee
the safety of the Turkish Army, adding that they had referred the matter to the German
Grand Headquarters Staff, who entirely approved of his action.France supporting the Ottoman Empire
France sided with Islam in the 16 and 17 centuries when they actively helped the
Ottoman Empire against Spain and Austria. Examples of this: Kheir-ad-Din Barbarossa
harboured his fleet in Marseilles. Most notably the French did not go to help Vienna
against the Ottomans in 1683, but launched a military campaign of conquest in German
lands.
More recent and ongoing acts of treason
- Europe’s (especially Frances) refusal to aid Christian Lebanon militarily against
Middle Eastern Jihad.
- Europe’s refusal to aid Christian Sudan, Nigeria etc. militarily against African
Jihad.
- Implementation of the EU’s Eurabia project (European multiculturalism)
- NATO bombing of Serb forces in 1999.
- Support to the Global Islamic Ummah (Palestinians) etc.
- Europe’s unwillingness to to assist their Christian cousins in a range of conflicts;
Middle East, Asia, Africa.
- Europe’s unwillingness to to assist fellow Europeans in South Africa, Rhodesia and
other ex-colonies 3060 (probably close to 10 000+) European South Africans have
been massacred since the old regime fell.
- The US pressure for Turkeys EU membership.
- The granting of NATO membership to Albania in 2009.
- US and EU export of modern weapons to Muslim countries; Pakistan, Saudi-
Arabia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Oman, Marocco, Yemen and
Tunisia.

The Jihad and Islamisation of Sindh (Pakistan)
Muhammad bin Qasim Al-Thaqafi (695–715), born Muhammad bin Qasim bin Yusuf
Sakifi, was a Syrian general who conquered the Sindh and Punjab regions along the
Indus river (now a part of Pakistan). The conquest of Sindh and Punjab began the Islamic
era in South Asia and continues to lend the Sindh province of Pakistan the name Bab-e-
Islam (The Gateway of Islam)

Resources
There are a great number of books in print relating to the Templars, past Crusades and
medieval history. A majority are historical publications are based on archaeological and
chronicled evidence. Many of these publications are available through the Freemasons
libraries worldwide while others can be acquired through Amazon.com.
Although a majority of modern chivalric organisations function mostly as symbolic
charities they are renowned for their thorough studies of historical works.
Places of interest
I would strongly advice all Justiciar Knights to visit Valetta, Malta and Jerusalem, Israel
and to visit all the Knights Templar historical sites. There are various Templar buildings in
several European countries; France the UK, Portugal, Spain, Italy etc.
